## SurfaceFitter3D
Fitting planes and rectangles to surfaces in heightmaps
### Description
This Sample shows how to use PixelRegions and 3D shapes to select points for fitting.
Rectangles are fitted to different sets of points and the angle between planes is
calculated. The use of a plane as reference for the threshold function is illustrated.
### How to Run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Results can be seen in the 3D viewer and 2D viewer on the DevicePage.
Select Reflectance in the View: box at the top of the GUI and zoom in on the
data for best experience.
Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show the heightmap after loading the web-page.
To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine >= V2.5.0 is
required. For example SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the Emulator
on AppStudio 2.3 or higher can be used.
